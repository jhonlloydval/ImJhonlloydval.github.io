# PORTFOLIO WEBSITE  
![awan](Portfolio_homep.png)
This is a personal portfolio website created to showcase my skills, projects, and experience as a first-year Computer Science student aspiring to be a Software Engineer. The format of the website is inspired by HowToWebDev; however, I made the website entirely myself using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. I also integrated a website link in the Services section made from third-party web development software.  

The website includes details about my background, achievements and education, services (Blog, Projects, and Photography), and personal information.
